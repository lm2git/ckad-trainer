# CKAD Trainer - Interactive CKAD Simulator

Welcome to the **CKAD Trainer**! This is an interactive simulator designed to help you prepare for the **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exam. The simulator provides a series of randomized questions and scenarios to test your Kubernetes skills in a hands-on environment.

---

## Features

- **Randomized Questions**: Questions are shuffled to ensure a unique experience every time.
- **Interactive Verification**: After attempting a solution, the simulator verifies your answer and provides feedback.
- **Color-Coded Output**: Clear visual feedback with color-coded messages for correct and incorrect answers.
- **Dynamic Question Pool**: Questions are loaded from a directory (`q-pool`), making it easy to add or modify questions.

---

## How It Works

1. **Question Display**: Each question is displayed with a prompt to complete the task.
2. **Solution Verification**: After attempting the solution, the simulator runs a verification command to check your work.
3. **Feedback**: If the solution is correct, you'll receive a green ‚úÖ and move to the next question. If incorrect, you'll see a red ‚ùå and can try again.
4. **Completion**: Once all questions are completed, you'll receive a congratulatory message üéâ.
